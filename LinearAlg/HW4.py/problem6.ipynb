    "# Comparing Language as Vectors with Word2Vec and Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you'll use a popular technique called Word2Vec that represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The key idea is that words that are used in similar ways will be close to each other in this space. You can read the original paper by Mikolov et al. [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec uses a shallow neural network to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. It has two main architectures for training: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW):** This model predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words. For example, given the sentence \"the cat sat on the mat,\" CBOW would use the words \"the,\" \"sat,\" \"on,\" and \"the\" to predict \"cat\".\n",
    "- **Skip-Gram:** This model works in the reverse manner of CBOW. It uses a target word to predict its surrounding context words. Using the same sentence, Skip-Gram would take \"cat\" as input to predict \"the,\" \"sat,\" \"on,\" and \"the\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models rely on the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. Through training, Word2Vec adjusts the vectors so that words with similar meanings are positioned close to each other in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using it for language comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we don't need to know the exact details of how it works. We can use pre-trained Word2Vec models to compare languages. In this notebook, we'll use the `gensim` library to load a pre-trained Word2Vec model and compare the similarity of different words. The application for linear algebra is to experiment with cosine similarity, which measures the angle between two vectors. In this case, the result of cosine similarity will give us a measure of how similar two words are in meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. On canvas, you can find a file called `cse3380a4.yml` that lists all the libraries you'll need. You can install them by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f cse3380a4.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesn't work for you, you can find a list of the libraries you'll need below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gensim`\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "- `scipy==1.12.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the model, you'll need to download the pre-trained weights. You can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Z7UreEhC8Gm-PoWCWxXWSF0pFqgCUno/view?usp=sharing). Make sure you remember where you downloaded the file, as you'll need to provide the path to the model in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is downloaded and installed, you should be able to run the cell below. Note that this may take a few minutes to load the model."
